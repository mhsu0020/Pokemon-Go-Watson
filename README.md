# Pokemon-Go-Watson
Pokemon Go With Watson Visual Recognition API

Started during AT&T Shape Hackathon 2016.

1. Create a Bluemix account and create a Visual Recognition Service

2. Train a classifier with self-created Pokemon Go screenshots either by cloning and using the (sample trainer webapp)[https://visual-recognition-demo.mybluemix.net/] or through the SDK

3. Update Config.java with your configs

4. (optional) Set up a Websocket Server using (Node-RED)[https://developer.ibm.com/recipes/tutorials/creating-a-nodered-application-on-bluemix/] or (AT&T Flow Designer)[https://flow.att.io] and create flow using WebsocketNodeRED/flow.json.  

NOTE: Android classifier alert app based on fork from (https://github.com/mtsahakis/MediaProjectionDemo)[https://github.com/mtsahakis/MediaProjectionDemo]
